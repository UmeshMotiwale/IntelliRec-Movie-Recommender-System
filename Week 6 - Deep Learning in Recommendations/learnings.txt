#Neural Networks for Recommendations:
Studied the architecture and functioning of deep neural networks, with a focus on embedding layers that convert sparse categorical data (like user/item IDs) into dense vector representations.

#Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF):
Implemented a neural network-based model to capture complex user-item interactions.
Learned how to replace matrix factorization with a trainable neural model.
