# Hybrid Recommendation Systems:
Developed models that combine the strengths of content-based and collaborative filtering.Learned how hybrid systems can outperform standalone methods in terms of accuracy and flexibility.

#Cold-Start Problem Handling:
Investigated strategies to handle situations where new users or items have little or no interaction history.Incorporated user and item metadata (e.g., demographics, product features) to enrich the recommendation process.

#Embeddings & Visualization:
Extracted and analyzed user/item embeddings to understand underlying patterns in the data.
Used dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for visualizing high-dimensional embeddings.
